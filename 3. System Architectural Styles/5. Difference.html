🧠 MEMORY TRICK (GOLD)
==========================================================================================================================

🔵 Request–Response → "Ask & WAIT"
🟦 Message-Driven   → "Do THIS job (once)"
🟢 Pub/Sub          → "Tell EVERYONE"
🟡 Event-Driven     → "Something happened → REACT"

==========================================================================================================================
🎤 INTERVIEW ONE-LINER
==========================================================================================================================

“Request–Response is synchronous and tightly coupled, Message-Driven focuses on task execution with ACKs,
Pub/Sub broadcasts messages to multiple subscribers, and Event-Driven Architecture designs systems that react
to events using these messaging patterns underneath.”
==========================================================================================================================


Key Takeaways
✅ Use Request-Response when you need immediate feedback.
✅ Use Pub/Sub when multiple services need the same message.
✅ Use Message-Driven when each task should be handled by exactly one service.
✅ Use Event-Driven for highly reactive, dynamic systems.
