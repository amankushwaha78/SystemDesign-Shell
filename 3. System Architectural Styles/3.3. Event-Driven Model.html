3️⃣ EVENT-DRIVEN MODEL (EDA)
===========================================================

📌 DEFINITION (Beginner Friendly)
--------------------------------
The Event-Driven Model is an **asynchronous architecture**
where services communicate by:
👉 **emitting events**
👉 **reacting to events**

Instead of calling each other directly, services:
- Publish events when something happens
- React to events they are interested in

-----------------------------------------------------------
🧠 ONE-LINE MEANING (VERY IMPORTANT)
-----------------------------------
👉 System reacts to events

    Event happens → listeners react

===========================================================
📌 WHAT IS AN EVENT?
===========================================================

An **event** is:
👉 A fact that something already happened

Examples:
- UserRegistered
- OrderPlaced
- PaymentCompleted
- ItemShipped

⚠️ Events are **NOT commands**
They describe **what happened**, not what to do.

===========================================================
🧩 CORE COMPONENTS
===========================================================

1️⃣ Event Producer (Event Source)
--------------------------------
- A service that **creates an event**
- Publishes event when state changes
- Does NOT know who consumes it

Example:
- Order Service emits "OrderPlaced"

-----------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ Event Broker / Event Bus
----------------------------
- Central system that receives and routes events
- Delivers events to interested services

Examples:
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ
- AWS EventBridge
- Redis Streams

-----------------------------------------------------------

3️⃣ Event Consumer (Listener)
-----------------------------
- A service that **listens to events**
- Reacts independently
- Multiple consumers can react to the same event

Examples:
- Payment Service
- Email Service
- Inventory Service

===========================================================
🔁 HOW EVENT-DRIVEN MODEL WORKS (STEP-BY-STEP)
===========================================================

Step 1️⃣ Event occurs
--------------------
- A user action or system change happens
- Example: User places an order

-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 2️⃣ Event is published
---------------------------
- Order Service publishes "OrderPlaced" event
- Event is sent to the Event Bus

-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 3️⃣ Event is routed
-----------------------
- Event Bus finds all subscribers
- Routes event to them

-----------------------------------------------------------

Step 4️⃣ Services react
----------------------
- Payment Service → processes payment
- Email Service → sends confirmation
- Inventory Service → updates stock

👉 All services work **asynchronously**
👉 No service blocks another

===========================================================

🌍 REAL-WORLD EXAMPLE (E-COMMERCE)
===========================================================

Event:
- "OrderPlaced"

Producer:
- Order Service

Consumers:
- Payment Service
- Email Service
- Inventory Service

Flow:
🛒 Order Service → emits "OrderPlaced"
💳 Payment Service → charges payment
📧 Email Service → sends confirmation
📦 Inventory Service → updates stock

👉 Order Service DOES NOT know who reacted

===========================================================
🔔 REAL-LIFE ANALOGY (BEST ONE)
===========================================================

Doorbell Example:
-----------------
1️⃣ Someone presses doorbell
2️⃣ Bell rings
3️⃣ Different people react differently

- Parents open door
- Dog starts barking
- Baby wakes up

👉 Bell doesn’t know who reacts  
👉 Same event, multiple reactions

===========================================================
⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE (VERY COMMON CONFUSION)
===========================================================

✔ Event-Driven Model usually uses **Pub/Sub internally**
✔ Pub/Sub = **message delivery mechanism**
✔ Event-Driven = **system design philosophy**

👉 Pub/Sub answers: "How messages are delivered?"
👉 Event-Driven answers: "How system behaves?"

===========================================================
✅ ADVANTAGES
===========================================================

✅ 1. Loose Coupling  
- Services don’t depend on each other
- Easy to add/remove services

✅ 2. High Scalability  
- New consumers can be added anytime
- No change needed in producer

✅ 3. Real-Time Responsiveness  
- Services react instantly to events

✅ 4. Resilience  
- Failure of one service does NOT stop others

✅ 5. Event Replay  
- Stored events can be replayed to rebuild state

===========================================================
❌ DISADVANTAGES
===========================================================

❌ 1. Event Ordering  
- Maintaining correct sequence is hard

❌ 2. Debugging Difficulty  
- Async flows are hard to trace

❌ 3. Increased Complexity  
- Needs brokers, monitoring, tracing

❌ 4. Latency  
- Multiple async hops may add delay

❌ 5. Access Control  
- Restricting who consumes which events needs extra setup

===========================================================
📌 BEST USE CASES
===========================================================

1️⃣ Microservices communication  
2️⃣ Real-time systems  
3️⃣ Streaming & analytics  
4️⃣ IoT & sensor systems  
5️⃣ Highly scalable distributed systems

===========================================================
🏁 INTERVIEW-READY SUMMARY (2-LINES)
===========================================================

“In Event-Driven Architecture, services emit and react to events 
asynchronously via an event bus like Kafka or RabbitMQ.  
It improves scalability and decoupling but makes ordering and debugging harder.”

🆚 EVENT-DRIVEN vs REQUEST-RESPONSE
===========================================================

Event-Driven:
👉 Publish event when something happens
👉 No waiting for response
👉 Asynchronous

Request-Response:
👉 Ask for data/action
👉 Wait for response
👉 Synchronous

⚠️ Event-Driven systems often use Pub/Sub internally
