<!-- 
1️⃣ High-Speed Reads/Writes & Horizontal Scaling  DBs:   =>   Cassandra | DynamoDB | MongoDB     
   --------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: Uber for storing real-time live GPS locations of drivers.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you book a cab in Uber, the app continuously updates the driver's location every second.
    b. Cassandra is used because it writes & reads millions of location updates per second while scaling horizontally across different regions. 


2️⃣ Chat & Real-Time Messages DBs:                        =>   Cassandra | MongoDB
   -----------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: WhatsApp & Slack for chat storage.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you send a message on WhatsApp, it gets stored in MongoDB for fast retrieval & real-time syncing across devices.
    b. Since messages arrive continuously, MongoDB's flexible JSON format makes storing & retrieving chats super fast.


3️⃣ Complex Queries & Structured Data DBs:               =>   PostgreSQL | MySQL          
    --------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: Amazon & Netflix for structured data like users & transactions.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you buy a product on Amazon, the order details are stored in MySQL/PostgreSQL.
    b. Since Amazon has millions of users & transactions, it uses SQL-based queries to retrieve orders, payments, and inventory details efficiently.


4️⃣ AI-Driven Relationship Recommendations DBs:           =>   Neo4j (GraphDBs)
   --------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: LinkedIn & Facebook for suggesting connections.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you see "People You May Know" on Facebook/LinkedIn, it finds common connections using Neo4j (Graph Database).
    b. It can quickly traverse relationships like "Ananya knows Raj, Raj knows Sam, so Ananya might know Sam."


5️⃣ Session Management & Fast Lookups DBs:                =>   Redis | Memcached
   --------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: Twitter & Instagram for user sessions & caching.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you log into Instagram, it doesn't fetch your data from the main database every time.
    b. Instead, Redis caches your session details, so you stay logged in & see your feed instantly.


6️⃣ Cloud Image Storage DBs:                              =>    AWS S3 | Google Cloud Storage
   --------------------------------------------------
    ✅ Used by: Instagram, YouTube, and Google Photos for media storage.

    🔹 Real-Life Example:
    a. When you upload a photo on Instagram, it gets stored in AWS S3.
    b. Since S3 automatically scales and provides high availability, your images remain safe & load quickly anytime you open the app.
