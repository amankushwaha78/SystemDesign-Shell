<!-- 
1. SQL Databases (Relational) :
------------------------------
SQL databases use structured schemas and follow ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties. 
Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL.

✅ Advantages:
--------------
    1. Structured Data – Uses tables with predefined schemas.

    2. ACID Compliance – Ensures reliable transactions.
       NOte :
        a. Atomicity → A transaction is all or nothing (e.g., if payment processing fails, money isn't deducted).
        b. Consistency → Database remains in a valid state before and after a transaction.
        c. Isolation → Multiple transactions don’t interfere with each other.
        d. Durability → Once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved, even if a system crashes.

    3  Joins & Relationships – When you require Supports of **complex queries** and relationships between tables.
    4. Strong Consistency    – Guarantees that all transactions remain valid.
    5. Mature Ecosystem      – Decades of optimization and tooling (Most Secure DB of all time).

❌ Disadvantages:
-----------------
    1. Scalability Challenges – Harder to scale horizontally; usually scales vertically.
    2. Fixed Schema – Changes in schema require migrations, which can be costly.
    3. Performance Issues – Can become slow with large-scale unstructured data.

📚 Best Use Cases:
-----------------
    1. Banking & Finance (strong consistency needed).
    2. Applications requiring complex relationships (ERP, CRM).
    3. Data analytics where SQL queries are essential.

<!-- 
2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational) :
-------------------------------------
NoSQL databases offer schema-less, scalable, and high-performance storage. 
They often follow BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent). 

➡️ **BASE** properties — ensures *high availability and scalability*.

B → **Basically Available**  
     → The system is always up, but data may be stale for a while.  

A → **Soft State**  
     → Data can change over time, even without new input (due to eventual sync).  

E → **Eventually Consistent**  
     → All nodes will have the same data *eventually*, not instantly.  

     
Types include Document, Key-Value, Column-Family, and Graph databases.

✅ Advantages:
--------------
    1. Flexible Schema – Can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data.
    2. High Scalability – Easily scales horizontally (distributed across multiple servers).
    3. Fast Reads/Writes – Optimized for high-throughput and real-time data.
    4. Varied Data Models – Supports key-value, document, column-family, and graph models.
    5. Good for Big Data – Handles large amounts of data efficiently.

❌ Disadvantages:
-----------------
    1. Acid is not guaranteed.
    2. Readability is not good.
    3. Joints are hard to implement.
    4. Eventual Consistency – NoSQL databases are not always strict to consistency.
    5. Limited Querying – Lacks powerful SQL querying and JOIN support.
    6. Data Duplication – No normalization, leading to redundant data storage.

<!-- 
3. Hybrid Approach :
---------------------
Many modern applications use a hybrid approach:
    a. Use SQL for critical transactional data.
    b. Use NoSQL for real-time features, logging, caching, or large-scale unstructured data. 
    
Final Thoughts :
----------------
    a. Go for SQL if you need strong consistency, complex queries computations, and structured data.
    b. Go for NoSQL if you need scalability, flexibility, and high performance for unstructured data.
    c. Hybrid solutions can leverage both strengths for an optimal system design.
