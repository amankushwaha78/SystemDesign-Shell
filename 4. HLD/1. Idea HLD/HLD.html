🌐 COMPLETE REQUEST FLOW — DECISION BASED SYSTEM DESIGN
( HOW REGION, LOAD BALANCER & SERVERS ARE CHOSEN )
====================================================================================================

This file focuses ONLY on:
✔ How traffic is routed
✔ How region is selected
✔ How best server is chosen
✔ How failures are handled
✔ How L4 vs L7 decide routing

(No subnet / VPC / infra theory here)

====================================================================================================
🧠 BIG PICTURE (REMEMBER THIS)
====================================================================================================

User request goes through MULTIPLE decision points.

Each layer answers ONE QUESTION:

DNS / Global LB   → Which REGION?
L4 Load Balancer  → Which CONNECTION target?
L7 Load Balancer  → Which APPLICATION / SERVER?
Service Layer    → Which INSTANCE?
Retry Logic      → What if it fails?


====================================================================================================
6️⃣ COMPLETE DECISION FLOW (END TO END)
====================================================================================================

User
 ↓
DNS → Choose best REGION (latency + health)
 ↓
L4 LB → Choose best TCP target
 ↓
L7 LB → Choose correct SERVICE
 ↓
Service LB → Choose best INSTANCE
 ↓
Process request
 ↓
Response returned

====================================================================================================
🧠 FINAL MEMORY TRICK (INTERVIEW GOLD)
====================================================================================================

DNS   → WHERE (region)
L4    → WHICH connection
L7    → WHICH service
Svc   → WHICH instance
Retry → WHAT if failure

====================================================================================================
🎤 INTERVIEW ONE-LINER
====================================================================================================

“A client request is first routed to the best region using DNS based on latency and health,
then distributed by an L4 load balancer at the connection level, routed by an L7 load balancer
using HTTP semantics, processed by the best available service instance, and retried safely
in case of failures.”
