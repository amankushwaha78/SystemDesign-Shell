👉 Consistent hashing is a way to distribute data or requests across servers so that adding/removing a server 
causes minimal reshuffling.

It is widely used in distributed caching, distributed databases and load balancing. 


Why is Consistent Hashing Needed?
---------------------------------
In a traditional modulo-based hashing system for Load Balancing:

    If there are N servers, a key (request) is assigned to a server using:
    [ server_index where request will go = hash(key) % N ]

When a server is added or removed, almost all keys need to be remapped, causing high overhead.
Consistent Hashing solves this problem by minimizing remapping when the number of servers changes.

Example :
 let r1 => 10     let N = 4 (Total Number of Servers)
     r2 => 20     r1,r2,r3 = Incoming Request on System
     r3 => 30

     Sever_Index  for r1 = hash(r1) % 4 =  hash(10) % 4  = 3 % 4  =>  3
     Sever_Index  for r2 = hash(r2) % 4 =  hash(20) % 4  = 15 % 4  => 3
     Sever_Index  for r3 = hash(r3) % 4 =  hash(30) % 4  = 20 % 4  => 0

     r3  ------------ > |🗄️ Server 0 |

                        |🗄️ Server 1 |

                        |🗄️ Server 2 |

     r1, r2 --------- > |🗄️ Server 3 |

Suppose our server become famous we introduced a new server for handeling more load.
Now N = 5   

     Sever_Index  for r1 = hash(r1) % 4 =  hash(10) % 5  = 3 % 5  =>  3
     Sever_Index  for r2 = hash(r2) % 4 =  hash(20) % 5  = 15 % 5  => 0
     Sever_Index  for r3 = hash(r3) % 4 =  hash(30) % 5  = 20 % 5  => 2

     r2  ----------- >  |🗄️ Server 0 |

                        |🗄️ Server 1 |

     r3 ------------ >  |🗄️ Server 2 |

     r1 -- --------- >  |🗄️ Server 3 |

                        |🗄️ Server 4 |

    OBSERVE : Now because of this normal hashing policy entire system has changed.
              r3, r2 unncessarily changed its server.
              Entire cache in sever is useless now.
              Server 0 have cache of r3 ie. Useless now.
              Server 3 have cache of r2 ie. Useless now.
