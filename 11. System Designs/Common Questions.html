<!-- 
🔹 How you will choose the Right DB Based on Needs ? :
-----------------------------------------------------
1. For high-speed reads/writes & horizontal scaling → Use Cassandra  | DynamoDB | MongoDB

2. For complex queries & structured data            → Use PostgreSQL |  MySQL

3. For AI-driven relationship recommendations       → Use Neo4j      | AWS Neptune (GraphDBs)

4. For session management & fast lookups            → Use Redis      | Memcached

5. For chat & real-time messages                    → Use Cassandra  | MongoDB

6. For cloud image storage                          → Use AWS S3     | Google Cloud Storage
-->

<!-- 
🔹 How you will optimize Database for Performance ?:
----------------------------------------------------

To handle millions of users efficiently:

1. Use Caching (Redis) → Speeds up frequently requested data
2. Database Indexing → Makes queries faster
3. Shard Databases → Distribute load across multiple servers
4. Use CDNs (Cloudflare/AWS CloudFront) → Serve media files faster 
-->


<!-- 
📌 Deployment Strategy :
------------------------

1. Use Kubernetes (K8s) & Docker → For managing microservices
2. CI/CD Pipeline (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) → Automate deployments
3. Monitor Logs (Prometheus, Grafana) → Track performance issues
 -->



<!-- 
🔹 Why did you choose a microservices architecture? :
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Scalability: Services scale independently (e.g., Feed Service can scale separately from User Service).
2. Fault Tolerance: If one service fails, others remain functional.
3. Technology Flexibility: Each service can use the best database and tech stack.
4. Improved Maintainability: Easier to develop, deploy, and update without affecting other parts.
