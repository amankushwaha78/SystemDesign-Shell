❤️ Swipe & Match Process :
---------------------------
🔹 Services Involved :  
    ✅ Matching Service(DynamoDB) – Manages swipes & match algorithm  
    ✅ Recommendation Service(Neo4j GraphDB) – Suggests potential matches  

🔹 Flow : 
    1️⃣ User swipes left/right on a profile  
    2️⃣ The Matching Service records the swipe in DynamoDB (Matches DB)  
    3️⃣ If both users swipe right, a match event is triggered  
    4️⃣ Recommendation Service (powered by AI) suggests new matches based on user preferences (stored in Neo4j GraphDB)  

The Matching Service is responsible for handling user interactions, swipes, and match recommendations in a dating app like Tinder. It integrates AI-based ML algorithms to optimize matchmaking and ensures real-time updates for a seamless user experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1️⃣ User Swipes on a Profile
### Trigger:
- A user swipes right (like) or left (dislike) on another profile.

### System Flow:
1. The frontend captures the swipe action and sends it to the API Gateway (Nginx).
2. The API Gateway forwards the request to the Matching Service.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2️⃣ Matching Service – Core Functionality
### Microservice Involved:  
✅ Matching Service (Handles swipes, match decisions, and compatibility calculations)

### Process:
1. Validates User Status:  
   - Ensures both users have active profiles.
   - Checks for blocked/muted accounts.

2. Stores Swipe Action in Matches DB:  
   - The system logs the user's swipe into DynamoDB (Matches DB) for fast retrieval.

3. Checks for a Mutual Match:  
   - If User A has already liked User B, and User B swipes right on User A, it’s a match!
   - If no mutual like yet, the system waits for the second user's action.

4. Triggers Notification for a Match:  
   - When a mutual match occurs, the Push Notification Service sends an alert (e.g., Firebase, Twilio).
   - The app UI updates in real time to show the match.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3️⃣ AI-Based Matchmaking Algorithm
### Microservice Involved:  
✅ Recommendation Service (AI-powered matchmaking engine)

### Process:
1. Graph-Based Matching:  
   - The system uses Neo4j (GraphDB) to analyze user interactions, preferences, and common interests.
   - The graph database structures users as nodes and their interactions as edges to find meaningful connections.

2. Behavior-Based Recommendations:  
   - AI analyzes previous swipes, conversations, and engagement levels.
   - Suggests profiles that align with the user's activity patterns.

3. Location & Preference Filtering:  
   - The system applies filters such as:
     - Location-based filtering (Users in the same city or preferred radius)
     - Demographics (Age, gender, interests)
     - Profile attributes (Occupation, hobbies, bio keywords)

4. Ranking & Prioritization:  
   - The algorithm assigns a compatibility score to potential matches.
   - Higher-ranked profiles appear first in the swipe feed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4️⃣ Real-Time Updates & Cache Optimization
### Microservice Involved:  
✅ Session Service (Handles real-time matching updates)

### Process:
1. Uses Redis for Fast Lookup:  
   - Swipe data is cached in Redis for real-time performance.
   - If Redis cache misses, it fetches data from DynamoDB (Matches DB).

2. Instant Match Updates:  
   - When a match is formed, updates are pushed instantly to both users via WebSockets (Chat Service).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5️⃣ Handling Edge Cases
### Microservice Involved:  
✅ Matching Service

| Scenario | System Handling |
|-------------|---------------------|
| One user swipes right, but the other hasn’t yet | Stores action in Matches DB and waits for the second swipe. |
| One user unmatches the other | Deletes the match record from DynamoDB and clears cache. |
| User blocks another user | Blocks the profile in Profile Service, prevents matching. |
| Fake/bot accounts detected | AI flags suspicious behavior, bans the account. |

--------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6️⃣ Summary of Services & Databases Used
| Component | Purpose |
|------------------------|------------|
| Matching Service | Handles swipe logic, mutual matches |
| Recommendation Service | AI-powered profile suggestions |
| Session Service | Real-time match updates via Redis |
| DynamoDB (Matches DB) | Stores swipe history and matches |
| Neo4j / GraphDB | AI-based relationship tracking |
| Redis (Cache) | Fast lookup for active matches |
| Push Notification Service | Alerts users when a match occurs |

--------------------------------------------------------------------

This scalable Matching Service ensures:
✅ Real-time swipes & matches  
✅ AI-powered matchmaking  
✅ Optimized database queries  
✅ Instant notifications for new matches
