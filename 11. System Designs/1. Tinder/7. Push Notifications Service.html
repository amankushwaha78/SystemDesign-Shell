🔔 5️⃣ Push Notifications & Event Processing  
🔹 Services Involved :  
    ✅ Push Notification Service – Sends notifications (matches, messages)  
    ✅ Kafka (Event Streaming) – Processes large-scale events  

🔹  Flow : 
    1️⃣ If a user gets a match or message, a notification event is sent to Kafka  
    2️⃣ Kafka forwards the event to the Push Notification Service  
    3️⃣ The service uses Firebase / Twilio / SNS to send a real-time notification to the user’s device 
    

1️⃣ Push Notifications (Firebase, Twilio, etc.) :
------------------------------------------------
     a. **Purpose:** Notify users about unread messages when they are offline.  
     b. **Service Used:** Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Twilio, or other push notification services.

     How It Works:
    1️⃣ User B is Offline : 
         a. When User A sends a message to User B, but **User B is offline**, the chat service **stores the message** in the database (Cassandra).  
         b. The **Session Service (Redis)** checks if User B is active or not.  
         c. If offline, the chat system triggers a **push notification request** to Firebase/Twilio.

    2️⃣ Triggering the Push Notification :
        a. The **Push Notification Service** (Firebase, Twilio) sends a notification to User B’s **registered device tokens**.  
           Example:  
            - "You have a new message from User A!"
            - "💬 Alex sent you a message. Tap to reply!"

        b. User B Opens the App**  
            i).  The app **connects to the chat service via WebSockets/XMPP** and fetches unread messages.  
            ii). Messages stored in **Redis (cache)** are delivered instantly.

    🔹Benefits of Push Notifications:
    ---------------------------------
        ✅ Ensures users **don’t miss** messages even if they are offline.  
        ✅ Reduces **server load** since the app doesn’t need to keep polling for new messages.  
        ✅ Works across devices (mobile, web).  

Both **Push Notifications** and **Kafka Event Processing** work together to ensure **real-time, seamless, and scalable chat messaging.** 🚀
